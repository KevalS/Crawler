When speaking about the Apple computer, he said it was \u201Cgoing to be insanely beautiful.\u201D Over the years, Apple\u2019s products have worked to fuse innovative technology with almost artful design. The iMac stunned the world with its colorful plastic shells, which the <em>New York Times</em> said \u201Cmore closely resemble a pack of Life Savers than a new computer line.\u201D The glossy white iPod\u2014no bigger than a deck of playing cards\u2014could hold an entire library of music. <em>Time Magazine</em> named the iPhone the Invention of the Year for its stunning design and\u2014uniquely\u2014because of the promise it held for even better products in the future. With each new item they launch, Apple works to shape the way future societies communicate, learn, and dance when they're alone.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p><i>To complete your Goods order, simply purchase this Groupon and provide your name and shipping address.\n<br/><br/>\nPlease check the Fine Print for this deal\u2019s estimated delivery timeframe.
