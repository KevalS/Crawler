Here are some suggestions for making your wedding an original, spectacular, lovetastic journey:\r\n\r\n* Mason jars instead of champagne flutes\r\n\r\n* You're not the kind of person who would want a cake like everyone else's, so make the cake out of grilled steaks and have the frosting be mashed potatoes.\r\n\r\n* You won't want gifts, so just have a station where people can write short works of magical realist fiction about you and your fianc\u00E9.\r\n\r\n* Instead of a ring bearer, use a trained miniature horse. He hands out pamphlets about a charity working to save a rare breed of sparrows that are going extinct on Georgia farms.\r\n\r\n* Tables are boring, but piles of freshly cut firewood aren't.\r\n\r\n* Replace the guests with glass orbs full of water and rose petals. Replace your fianc\u00E9 with a scarecrow made of your mom's vintage scarves.","emailContent":"Where is the best local farm to find a ring bearer?","id":"the-groupon-guide-to-a-unique-wedding"},"areas":[],"isMerchandisingDeal":false,"isGliveInventoryDeal":false,"isSoldOut":false,"uuid":"64db49dc-123f-11e2-9593-00259060b5c0","largeImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/xsR4bCQUmD1TEBCWcrv4/C4-440x267/v1/t440x300.jpg","tippedAt":"2012-10-14T20:44:46Z","grid4ImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/xsR4bCQUmD1TEBCWcrv4/C4-440x267/v1/t300x182.jpg","soldQuantityMessage":"560+","tippingPoint":0,"tags":[{"name":"Arts and Entertainment"}],"options":[{"expiresInDays":90,"soldQuantity":560,"endAt":"2037-02-18T03:59:59Z","redemptionLocations":[{"state":"New York","name":"","streetAddress2":"Suite 201","streetAddress1":"153 W 27th St.","lng":-73.9930334,"city":"Manhattan","neighborhood":"Chelsea","postalCode":"10011","lat":40.7464196,"phoneNumber":"212-206-7652","id":4674934,"country":"US"}],"remainingQuantity":0,"status":"open","discountPercent":60,"title":"One month of unlimited boot camp and fitness classes","discount":{"formattedAmount":"$90.00","amount":9000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyUrl":"https://www.groupon.com/deals/pace-for-success/confirmation?pledge_id=4855227","initialQuantity":0,"details":[{"description":"Limit 1 per person, may buy 2 additional as gifts.
