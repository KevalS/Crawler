The 15-minute <strong><a href=\"http://gr.pn/198v2dA\">Eye of the Beholder</a></strong> treatment starts with an ultra-gentle exfoliation, followed by the application of peptide-enhanced serums, along with a cooling eye mask, making puffiness and dark circles fade.  </p>\n\n<p>A <strong><a href=\"http://gr.pn/XoI1Ac\">Customized Facial</a></strong> takes place in a private room and begins with a consultation by expert aestheticians to help determine the best facial for your skin type such as oily, dry, dehydrated, mature, acne-prone, or combination. The service itself kicks off with a deep cleanse, tone, and scrub to prep the face before exfoliation, steam, and extractions clear out impurities and reveal a fresh complexion. A skin-specific mask, calming serum, and moisturizer finish the treatment.</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://gr.pn/198v3hw\">Microdermabrasion</a></strong> involves exfoliation using crystals to remove the outer surface of the skin to help even out skin tone, reduce pore size, remove dry, dehydrated skin, minimize fine lines and wrinkles, and prevent blemishes.

The Beta-Salicylic helps clear up oily, acne-prone skin; the Glycolic, good for anti-aging, brightens and evens skin tone; and the Lactic removes dry, dehydrated cells to aid in moisturizing sensitive skin.

Knowledgable and entertaining guides narrate <a href=\"http://gr.pn/yip9Jm\">tours</a> while patrons can indulge in a cash bar that provides refreshments along the way.
