Instead of budgeting for elegant decor, Akilova splurges on top-of-the-line products such as lavender-infused Lycon wax and plant-based <a href=\"http://www.decleor.com\">Decl\u00E9or</a> skincare serums, which she uses alongside seaweed extracts and OxyOasis anti-inflammatory agents in a retinue of facials that brighten the skin and evict blemishes. A talented staff of massage therapists pores over bodies with Swedish and deep-tissue massages and brings about a whole-body glow with sea-salt scrubs and self-tanning milks. Rounding out Akilova's luxurious menu is a buffet of mani-pedi treatments that incorporates hot stones and reflexology to put the finer touches onto fingers and toes that deserve their own accolades for laboring over scratch-and-sniff takeout menus.</p>","says":{"websiteContentHtml":"<p>Due to environmental factors, the encroachment of the cities of man, or invasive predators, new flora and fauna are being added to the list of threatened or endangered species every day.

It wafted from his Grandma Zoya's kitchen, where the future entrepreneur eagerly observed old-fashioned preparation methods and tasted generations-old recipes. Today, Gene hand rolls and kettle boils fresh bagels every morning to honor his grandmother's legacy, and, according to <a href=\"http://gr.pn/IM0yCt\">ABC News</a>, his are some of the few bagels to sneak seeds onto both sides.</p>\n\n<p>Although bagels\u2014prepared in flavors such as blueberry and pumpernickel\u2014may be the main attraction at this Woodside bakery, they certainly don't hog the spotlight. Born from real yogurt, butter, and flour, tins of kosher, handmade muffins accompany artisanal breads prepared from ancestral recipes that, like the music of ABBA, date back to 600 AD. For Francophile sweet teeth, the store's exclusive line of pastries from the Bridor company in France come straight out of the oven every morning.</p>","says":{"websiteContentHtml":"<p>It's fall movie season and you know what that means!

Here are some suggestions of what to do with the day-after detritus:\r\n\r\n* Melt down chocolates and put them in little ghost-shaped molds to start stocking up for Halloween.<br>\r\n\r\n* Once roses start to wilt and dry out, use their thorns to make devil horns for a naughty dog or precocious toddler.<br>\r\n\r\n* Diamond shavings are glitter.<br>\r\n\r\n* Recycle a Valentine's Day card by crossing out the part that says \"Lisa, I will always love you. You are my angel and my strength\" and writing \"Deepest sympathies on the anniversary of your terrible comeuppance!\"<br>\r\n\r\n* Leftover candy hearts? More like delicious croutons!<br>\r\n","emailContent":"Sweet croutons, this salad is good!","id":"the-groupon-guide-to-valentine-s-day-leftovers","title":"The Groupon Guide to: Valentine's Day Leftovers"},"textAd":{"headline":"","line2":"","line1":""},"startAt":"2013-02-16T05:00:00Z","grouponRating":1.5,"type":"groupon","isSoldOut":false,"displayOptions":[{"name":"timer","enabled":true},{"name":"quantity","enabled":true},{"name":"discount","enabled":true},{"value":"other","name":"merchandisingType"}],"soldQuantity":1000,"redemptionLocation":"Midtown Center","limitedQuantityRemaining":null,"grid4ImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/8CHGo2E775Gwvuqwq5XJ/ER-2048x1229/v1/t300x182.jpg","mediumImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/8CHGo2E775Gwvuqwq5XJ/ER-2048x1229/v1/t100x100.jpg","channels":[],"salesforceLink":"https://login.salesforce.com/006C000000hpowVIAQ","tags":[{"name":"Beauty & Spas"},{"name":"Skin Care & Facials"}],"id":"lia-schorr-3","recommendation":{},"areas":[],"dealTypes":[{"description":"Indulgent delights, from pastries and flowers to massages and mani-pedis","id":"pampered","name":"Pampered"},{"description":"Upkeep essentials, such as electric toothbrushes and laser hair removal ","id":"grooming","name":"Well-Groomed"}],"vip":"","soldQuantityMessage":"1,000+","merchant":{"twitterUrl":null,"uuid":"f009df98-a41f-11e1-afe1-00259060af1c","facebookUrl":null,"websiteUrl":"http://www.liaschorr.com","id":"lia-schorr","ratings":[{"reviewsCount":157,"rating":1.5,"linkText":"Yelp","id":"598547","url":"http://yelp.com/biz/lia-schorr-skin-care-inc-new-york/"}],"name":"Lia Schorr"},"placementPriority":"nearby","shippingAddressRequired":false,"isMerchandisingDeal":false,"title":"Massage with Body Scrub & Pedicure, or Facial,\u00A0Mini-Microdermabrasion &\uFEFF Mask at Lia Schorr (Up to\u00A076%\u00A0Off)","smallImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/8CHGo2E775Gwvuqwq5XJ/ER-2048x1229/v1/t50x50.jpg","endAt":"2037-06-23T04:59:59Z","division":{"lng":-73.987,"timezone":"Eastern Time (US & Canada)","lat":40.7561,"id":"new-york","timezoneIdentifier":"America/New_York","name":"New York City","timezoneOffsetInSeconds":-14400},"allowedInCart":false,"sidebarImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/8CHGo2E775Gwvuqwq5XJ/ER-2048x1229/v1/t200x300.jpg","accessType":"extended","status":"open","largeImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/8CHGo2E775Gwvuqwq5XJ/ER-2048x1229/v1/t440x300.jpg","isInviteOnly":false,"isOptionListComplete":true,"announcementTitle":"Up to \uFEFF76% Off Spa Packages at Lia Schorr","options":[{"uuid":"7e3eff24-7494-11e2-b627-0025906125f0","bookable":false,"externalUrl":null,"price":{"formattedAmount":"$49.50","amount":4950,"currencyCode":"USD"},"details":[{"description":"Limit 3 per person, may buy 1 additional as a gift.
